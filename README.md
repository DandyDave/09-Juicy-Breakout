# 09-Juicy-Breakout
First I added tweening to tiles and paddle at the start of every level. THough I am still trying to figure out how to make the ball
wait until the paddle and all the tiles are down to spawn.

I tried adding stretching to the paddle but I don't know how so get the size on an AnimatedSprite node in Godot. All I could find is getting the size of the texture of one frame of the animation but it has not worked so far.

Right now I am working on camera shake. I really enjoyed defCoding's take on screenshake, subtle and only being used when the ball makes contact with the tiles and not the wall, so I referenced it. I though I had everyhting working with my scripts but im being thrown an "invalid set index" error so its currently not in.
